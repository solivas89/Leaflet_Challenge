# Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.



**Import & Visualize the Data**

   When you visit the site you will see that I created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

	My Earthquake Site can be visited at the following link: https://solivas89.github.io/Leaflet_Challenge/
  
 * There are data markers thatreflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Popups are visibile when the markers are clicked on and will provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

![5-Advanced](Images/5-Advanced.png)

The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

* You will notice that there is a second plot that was exeecuted by grabbing data from a second source.

* You will find 3 different basemaps to choose from as well as the two separate data sets that are in overlays which can be turned on and off independently.
